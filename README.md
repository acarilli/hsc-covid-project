Social Capital and Response to COVID19
Social capital is a well-researched aspect of health outcomes, and scholars are beginning to understand the role it plays in the spread of COVID-19. We advance this emerging literature with a novel framework to analyze the conditions under which social capital influences the spread of COVID-19 and, more importantly, the extent to which social capital bolsters formal public health rules like lockdown orders. With state-level data on daily COVID-19 cases, a measure of policy stringency, and various measures of social capital, we find that states with higher levels of social capital and higher levels of policy stringency see lower prevalence rates. These results are robust to the inclusion of standard controls and various specifications. These results suggest that individuals play an important role in the spread and prevention of infectious diseases independent of formal, governmental public health responses because individuals create and facilitate social capital.
